#Chargen - A character generator
Chargen generates character descriptions, for use by concept artists, role-playing game DMs or anywhere a description could be useful

##Uses
Character descriptions can be generated by running the python script, or using the webpage (current version available online [here](http://chargen.github.com)).

### Commandline
Run the chargen.py file without parameters to print a single character description

	python chargen.py

Run the command again to generate a different description.

#### Generate the website
The website is compiled by the python script, using the current wordlists. The parameter to use is '-b' or '--build'

	python chargen.py -b
	
This will generate an "index.html" file with sufficient javascript to run in-browser locally.

### Website
The website automatically generates a character description. Click 'regenerate' to be given another.
####URL
Note that the url of the page changes to provide a way to link to randomly generated characters. The URL will look something like:
	
	{site_url}#!/23/5/68/34
